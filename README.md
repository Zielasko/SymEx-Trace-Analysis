# SymEx-Trace-Analysis

Python scripts for processing and analyzing RTrace files containing 
full symbolic execution traces of RISC-V programs. 

The trace is optimized and annotated for visualization and output as a PTrace file. 
If source code and DWARF info are available, the script also creates a .blk file.
